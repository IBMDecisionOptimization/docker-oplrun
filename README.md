# docker-oplrun
Configuration to build a docker container that contains only the oplrun runtime environment

Before running `docker build` you have to put a COS installer for Linux into the same directory as these files. Make sure you have only one such installer in the directory. The `Dockerfile` assume the installer file is called `cos_installer-*.bin`.
